Feedlex
=======

Feedly RSS reader client for Elixir (elixir-lang).

Partial but functional implementation. For now it covers the following Feedly APIs:
* authentication
* feed
* stream
* subscription

I'm planning on adding the rest of the core APIs. For now I have no plans on adding the
integration APIs (Dropbox, Evernote, Microsoft, etc) but I'll be happy to help if
anyone needs/adds them.

For a functional example, check out the demo app:
